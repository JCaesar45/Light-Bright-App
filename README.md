# Light-Bright App

An interactive web application inspired by the classic Light-Bright toy. Users can click or drag on circles to color them, change their colors, or remove colors with double-clicks. The app also provides options to reset recent or all colors.

## How It Works

- Colors are managed via an array of predefined colors for easy random selection.
- Reset buttons allow the user to clear colors selectively or completely.
